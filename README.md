  Value Investing is a century long investment theory proposed by Ben Graham and David Dodd
in 1928. It basically says that “markets systematically undervalue companies with high cash flow
but large book values and stable businesses”. If what this theory claims is true, a big challenge on
current efficient market theory is posed and a profitable investment opportunity is implied.
  For the past decades, this theory has been advocated by many famous investors including
Warrent Buffet, Laurence Tisch and Michael Larson, but whether their success is due to this
theory or luck is up to further research and analysis.
